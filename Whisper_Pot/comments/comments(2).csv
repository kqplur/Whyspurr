It's just from my perspective you know? I mean if you think about it test tiger is a -1 for yourself and at BEST a one for one. The meta has been slowly going towards rabbit/plants. Not saying that the tiger variant is BAD, I feel that the hero lives version is better. its like tiger glads 2.0, because of the fact that you are able to top deck a hero lives and do your tiger combo.
